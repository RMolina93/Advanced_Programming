**Assignment 3**

**Code and Answers for the Assignment 3 of the Advanced Programming Class.**

*1. Write an iterative version of the HANOITOWERS(n, fromPeg, toPeg) algorithm presented on Page 26 of the “An Introduction to Bioinformatics Algorithms” book (see lecture notes #1-2, slide #2 for full details of the book).*

	Done, the code is the script Hanoi.py

*2. Write the pseudocode to traverse a binary tree by levels but starting from leaves instead of the root (see lecture notes #5-6, slide #27 for the pseudocode for traversal by levels starting from the root). Provide the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm in terms of asymptotic bounds.*

	Done, code can be found in Traversal.py

*3. A graph G(V, E) is a bipartite graph if its vertices can be divided into two disjoint and independent sets U and W such that every edge connects a vertex in U to one in W (U ⊂ V, W ⊂ V, U ∩ W = ∅, U ∪ W = V ). A graph is bipartite if it is 2-colorable. That is, if one colors all nodes in U with one color, and all nodes in W with another color, each edge has endpoints of differing colors. Prove that a graph is bipartite iff (if and only if) it does not contain any odd-length cycles. (Hint: use possible configuration of vertices at the same levels in Breadth First Search).*

	Done, can be found in Bipartite_demo.pdf
