Assignment 3

Code and Answers for the Assignment 3 of the Advanced Programming Class.

1. Write an iterative version of the HANOITOWERS(n, fromPeg, toPeg) algorithm presented on Page 26 of the “An Introduction to Bioinformatics Algorithms” book (see lecture notes #1-2, slide #2 for full details of the book).

	Done, the code is the script Hanoi.py

2. Write the pseudocode to traverse a binary tree by levels but starting from leaves instead of the root (see lecture notes #5-6, slide #27 for the pseudocode for traversal by levels starting from the root). Provide the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm in terms of asymptotic bounds.

	Done, code can be found in Traversal.py
