This is the code for the assigned on the Advance Programming subject (APA) at Bioinformatics Master.
This code uses a linked list with inserted sort to organize the sequences into the different chromosomes, and after that it checks the spatial distance between them, to tell how many pairs of sequences are near in the space.

The statistics are the next ones:

n = 7 (input_1)

real	0m0.072s
user	0m0.023s
sys	0m0.039s

n = 1000 (input_2)

real	0m0.196s
user	0m0.112s
sys	0m0.055s

n = 10.000 (input_3)

real	0m6.200s
user	0m6.095s
sys	0m0.070s


n = 100.000 (input_4)

real	19m10.904s
user	18m59.502s
sys	0m3.084s

n = 1000000
